# TextField Properties

This project is made to show the text properties of a text field. 
I am to make radio buttons to switch the position of the text in the text field
left center and right alignment. Also have a text area with the size of the text
field that I can adjust to be larger or smaller.

## Analysis Steps

This section should restate the assignment and explain how you analyzed the requirements in order 
to develop a solution.

On this assignment I was to create a program that showed the text properties of a text field.
I saw that I had to create a text field, radio buttons, labels and another text field.
The radio buttons had to move text in main text field from left to right alignment when selected.
the secondary text field would make the primary text field larger or smaller.

### Design

How did you approach your program design? Did you use multiple classes to define various objects?

```
Give examples
```

### Testing

Set up pane
place main text field and fill it with text
create label for text field
set up radio buttons
set the buttons jobs
create label for buttons
tested and worked
set secondary text field and filled it with text
create method to change size of main text field
tested and worked
create label for secondary text field

I then ran the program and selected each button and the text moved, then I changed
the size of the text box smaller and larger and it worked.
